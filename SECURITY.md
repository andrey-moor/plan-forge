## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email or GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred): Use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/andrey-moor/plan-forge/security/advisories/new)
2. **Email**: Contact the maintainers directly

### What to Include

Please include the following information:

- Type of vulnerability (e.g., injection, authentication bypass, information disclosure)
- Location of the affected source code (file, line number if possible)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if available)
- Impact assessment and potential attack scenarios

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution Target**: Depends on severity, typically 30-90 days

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll confirm receipt of your report
2. **Assessment**: We'll investigate and assess the severity
3. **Updates**: We'll keep you informed of our progress
4. **Resolution**: We'll work on a fix and coordinate disclosure
5. **Credit**: We'll credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer anonymity)

## Security Considerations

### API Keys

- Never commit API keys to the repository
- Use environment variables for sensitive credentials
- The `.envrc` file is gitignored by default

### LLM Security

- Plans generated by LLMs should be reviewed before execution
- The tool does not automatically execute generated plans
- Be cautious when using plans in production environments

### Dependencies

- Dependencies are regularly updated for security patches
- We use `cargo audit` to check for known vulnerabilities
- The goose crate is sourced from a specific tagged version

## Security Best Practices for Users

1. **Protect your API keys**: Use environment variables, not config files
2. **Review generated plans**: LLM output should be validated before use
3. **Keep updated**: Use the latest version for security fixes
4. **Isolated environments**: Consider running in containers for additional isolation
